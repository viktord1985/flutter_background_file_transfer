/// A platform-independent interface for handling background file transfers.
///
/// This interface provides methods for uploading and downloading files in the background,
/// with support for progress tracking and cancellation. The implementation handles
/// platform-specific details for iOS and Android to ensure reliable background transfers
/// that continue even when the app is in the background.
///
/// Features:
/// * Background download and upload operations that continue when app is inactive
/// * Progress tracking through Dart streams
/// * Support for HTTP headers and multipart form fields
/// * Transfer status notifications
/// * Task cancellation
///
/// Platform-specific implementations:
/// * iOS: Uses URLSession background transfer capabilities
/// * Android: Uses WorkManager for reliable background processing
abstract class FileTransferHandler {

  ///
  /// [isEnabled] - When true, transfers will be queued and processed according to [maxConcurrent].
  /// When false, transfers will start immediately without queueing.
  ///
  /// [maxConcurrent] - The maximum number of concurrent transfers allowed when queue is enabled.
  /// Default is 1, which processes transfers serially.
  ///
  /// [cleanupDelay] - The delay in milliseconds before removing completed tasks from the queue.
  /// Default is 0, which means tasks are removed immediately when completed.
  /// Note: On iOS, this value will be automatically converted from milliseconds to seconds internally.
